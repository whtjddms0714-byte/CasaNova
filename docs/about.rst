CasaNova: Financial-Based Personalized Housing Recommendation System
--------------------------------------------------------------------

CasaNova is an open-source web application designed to help young adults in their 20s
determine a realistic housing budget based on their current financial status.

Unlike traditional real estate platforms, CasaNova analyzes real-world financial products
and applies loan eligibility logic using actual bank loan datasets or publicly available
financial APIs. Each loan recommendation reflects authentic market conditions such as
interest rates, minimum income requirements, credit requirements, and preferential rules.

Key Objectives
--------------

- Provide transparent, data-driven housing budget estimation
- Use *real financial products* for accurate loan simulation
- Support stable and realistic housing decisions for young adults
- Offer personalized property recommendations using lifestyle preference scoring
