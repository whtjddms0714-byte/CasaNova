How to Use CasaNova
================================

CasaNova guides users through a clear, three-step process to determine their financial capacity and find the most suitable property based on their preferences.

1. Financial Assessment (Budget Confirmation)
--------------------------------------------

The system first establishes your realistic purchasing power by analyzing your financial inputs.

- **Input Required:** Enter your **Monthly Income**, **Available Savings**, and **Existing Monthly Debt Payments**.
- **Loan Simulation:** The system automatically calculates your **Debt Service Ratio (DSR)** and determines the maximum loan amount you qualify for.
- **Loan Product Recommendation:** Based on your financial profile, the system recommends **multiple, simulated loan products** (e.g., Dream Home, Future Plan).
- **Selection:** You must then **select one loan product number** to integrate that specific amount into your final budget.

2. Customizing Preference Weights
-----------------------------------

After confirming your budget, you define what matters most to your lifestyle.

- **Manual Adjustment:** You are presented with four key infrastructure factors: **Park**, **School**, **Mart**, and **Public Transport**.
- **Weight Setting:** You **manually adjust the priority (weight)** for each factor within the application interface. The system allows you to directly control the weights of these factors to ensure the scoring matches your personal needs.
    - *Example:* If proximity to schools is critical, set a higher weight for 'School'.

3. Final Property Recommendation
--------------------------------

The final engine combines your confirmed budget and lifestyle preferences to present the optimal housing recommendations.

- **Budget Filtering:** The system automatically **filters out any properties** that exceed your confirmed total budget (Savings + Selected Loan Amount).
- **Matching Score:** The **Infrastructure Score** is calculated for the remaining properties by multiplying the property's proximity to amenities by your personalized preference weights.
- **Final Result:** Properties are ranked and displayed in descending order based on their **Infrastructure Score**, offering you the most financially feasible and desirable housing options.
