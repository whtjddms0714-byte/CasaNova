# Welcome to CasaNova: New Home, New Start.

<p class="mission-statement">
  CasaNova is an open-source web application designed to help young adults in their 20s confirm a realistic housing budget based on their current assets and income.
  
  Unlike traditional real estate platforms, CasaNova integrates and analyzes complex factors—such as DSR/DTI-emulating loan regulations and youth-targeted mock financial products—to support financially savvy and stable housing decisions.
